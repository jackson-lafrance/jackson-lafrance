## 🎯 Projects

### 📱 Symoda App and Website
- Used Xcode and Swift UI to design an app which allowed MSP users to open tickets, receive important announcements about system downtimes, and send messages/call support
- Made a website where MSPs could set up their service groups, add allowed domains, send messages, update users with announcements and customize their user's app design
- Integrated the two applications using Googles Firebase Firestore database and authentication service

### 🔧 Tech Army/Keep Connected Apps
- Made similar apps for two local tech support companies using React Native, allowing users to call support, live chat on iMessage, visit the company website, and send emails
- Also later developed an AI chatbot that users could talk to within the app, letting them get live support relating to their tech issues
- Finally added support for users to login to accounts and make their live support chats and AI conversations persistent

### 🎲 Wordle Clone
- Developed a Wordle clone for iOS so I could play it as much as I want and added different versions like 4-word Wordle, French Wordle, and more
- Integrated a multiplayer system using Firebase and added in quick matches, playing with friends, as well as a global leaderboard

### 🗺️ Ashbury Maps
- Used React Native to develop an iOS, android, and web app to provide mapping directions around my school for new students and people visiting for events
- Implemented Dijkstra's search algorithm for computing the fastest route from the user's location to their destination in the app
- Used AI to convert a map of the school into a number matrix to be used in the algorithm

### 💪 Vibranium App
- Used React Native and Expo Go to design an ironman training app, with built in strength training tracking
- Integrated the Strava to import a user's cardio training
- Used OpenAI's gpt-5 to allow the user to ask questions to a chatbot, with the AI having full access to all their training data so it can give informed advice
- Allowed users to create AI workouts, which would automatically be created in their saved workouts
- Connected a Google Firestore Database to save user data and handle account logins
